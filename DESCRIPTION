Description: Enables researchers to model log-file data from computer-based assessments using machine-learning techniques. It allows researchers to generate new knowledge by comparing the performance of three tree-based classification models (i.e., decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting) to predict student's outcome. It also contains a set of handful functions for the analysis of the features' influence on the modeling. Data from the Climate control item from the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA, <https://www.oecd.org/pisa/>) is available for an illustration of the package's capability.
