#' Data Partition
#'
#' @param data A \code{data.frame} that contains the studyâ€™s features and the outcome variable.
#' @param outcome A character string with the name of the outcome variable from the data.
#' @param proportion A numeric value for the proportion of data to be put into model training. Default is set to 0.7.
#' @param seed A numeric value for set.seed. It is set to be 2022 by default.
#'
#' @return This function returns a list with training and testing data sets using a stratified selection by the outcome variable as performed by the createDataPartition function from the caret package.
