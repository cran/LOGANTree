\usage{
ChiSquareTable(
  trainingdata = NULL,
  nfeatureNames = NULL,
  outcome = NULL,
  level = NULL,
  ModelObject = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trainingdata}{A data set used for training}

\item{nfeatureNames}{A vector of feature names that will be used for computing chi-square statistics}

\item{outcome}{A character string with the name of the binary outcome variable.}

\item{level}{A numerical value indicating the number of categories that the outcome contains}

\item{ModelObject}{A model object containing tree-based models}
}
\value{
This function returns a table with five columns. The chi-square statistics were computed as described by He & von Davier (2015).

Feature: Features names

CvAverageChisq: Average chisquare statistics computed from 10-fold cross validation samples

Rank.CvAverageChisq: Ordem of the feature importance from the CvAverageChisq measures#'

OverallChisq: chisquare scores computed from the whole training sample

Rank.OverallChisq: Ordem of the feature importance from the OverallChisq measures
