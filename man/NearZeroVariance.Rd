\title{Flag the features that have (near) zero variance}
\usage{
NearZeroVariance(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataset containing the studyâ€™s features.}
}
\value{
This function returns a dataframe with feature names and their frequency ratio, percentage of the unique value and logic values indicating whether the feature is zero variance or has near zero variance.

feature : name of the features.

flag.zv (Flag Zero Variance) : True/False, flagging zero variance.

fr (Frequency Ratio) : the ratio of the value with the highest frequency over the value with the second highest frequency.

puv (Percentage of Unique Values) : number of the unique values divided by the total number of samples.

flag.nzv (Flag Near Zero Variance) : True/False, flagging near zero variance.
